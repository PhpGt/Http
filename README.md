PSR-7 HTTP message implementation.
==================================

HTTP messages are the foundation of web development. Web browsers and HTTP clients such as cURL create HTTP request messages that are sent to a web server, which provides an HTTP response message. Server-side code receives an HTTP request message, and returns an HTTP response message.

Whatever tool kit a PHP web application is built upon, HTTP messages always behave in the same way. PSR-7 is a set of PHP interfaces defined by the [PHP Framework Interop Group][fig] in order to produce code that can be shared between application implementations.

This repository is an implementation of the PSR-7 interfaces for use within PHP.Gt/WebEngine, but can be used in any other PHP web application thanks to the interoperability of PSR-7.
