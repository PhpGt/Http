/**
 * Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. 302 has been superseded
 * by 303 and 307. This is an example of industry practice contradicting the
 * standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to
 * perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was
 * "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the
 * functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303
 * and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web
 * applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.
