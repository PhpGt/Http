 * code is not widely used. Google Developers API uses this status if a
 * particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. Sipgate uses
 * this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call.
 * Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is
 * temporarily disabled. Stripe uses this code for failed payments where
 * parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments.
