 * Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is

 * include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to
 * the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access
 * authentication. 401 semantically means "unauthorised", the user does not
 * have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
 * Note: Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned
 * from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is
 * refused permission to access a website.
